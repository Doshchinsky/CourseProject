Tick-tock, goes the clock,
He cradled her, and rocked her,
Tick-tock, goes the clock,
Even for the Doctor...

Doctor, brave and good,
He turned away from violence,
When he understood,
The falling of the silence...

Tick-tock, goes the clock,
He gave her all he could give her,
Tick-toock, goes the clock,
Now peison waits for River!
